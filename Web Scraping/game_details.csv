The parry window is very generous, predictable and reliable. \n\nThis game is very cool, and if biome variety holds up, definitely is a contender for a place in the 2D-souls pantheon.\n\nJust don\'t expect a Metroidvania ;)', 'So far, so very good. (sidenote: if you\'re not interested in reading this, just go check out the demo; I haven\'t played it, but I imagine it will tell you much of what I\'m about to)\n\nMore often these days, I try to base my impressions off of the beginning so that day-one buyers or interestees can make a decision more confidently. This is by no means a review of the full game, but rather a review of the first half-hour or so, since that will likely draw you in (or not).\n\nCombat plays very much like Dark Souls. If you\'re used to the attack, dodge, parry, attack rotation, then you will recognize the combat here. The good news is that the parry mechanic is baked into the game\'s design (it is the only way to heal), so the window for parrying is fairly generous and feels good when you nail it. The dodging feels very Symphony of the Night, but since it is tied to stamina, it still retains a Dark Souls boundary. The one [b]major[/b] bonus for me is that when you die, you [b]do not[/b] lose your ""souls."" As much I have enjoyed souls games, it is refreshing to see a game that borrows from Souls without feeling the need to push its oppressive nature on the game if its not needed. For this, I\'m not only grateful, but I respect the design more (maybe this changes later in the game, but for now, this is how it works).\n\nThematically, everything is expectedly cryptic and bizarre. The world is clearly one of surreal and cosmic horror. From the very beginning, it\'s clear that we\'re inside a reality that is very much unlike our own. If you\'re into surreal/cosmic stuff, then this is definitely a plus and, so far, everything is very satisfyingly creepy.\n\nThe navigation and exploration is Metroidvania to its core. Horizontal and vertical navigation through 2D levels, unlocking shortcuts and map reveals. My guess is that we\'ll probably see ability unlocks like the typical double jump or other tools that allow you to access new areas, much like its inspirers.\n\nSo far, that\'s about all I\'ve been through. I can\'t speak for boss design yet or viable builds or anything like that; my intent here was mostly to report on the basics of combat, the design, and how good it felt in the beginning (the answer is yes, it feels good). High recommend for cosmic horror/surreal and/or metroidvania fans.', 'Ignore other reviews, this is 100% a MV, its one large interconnected map with gated progression requiring movement and other upgrades, with tons of backtracking and looping back and hidden optional content. I highly recommend this game, the boss are the best in a MV since HK so far', 'Great game so far. Reminds me of Hollow Knight and Ender Lilies. Only this wrong with the game so far is just some minor bugs that can easily be fixed. If anyone cant attack when they get the weapon just alt tab out of the game than get back into the game and it fixes it.', 'All the people who keep saying it\'s ""not a Metroidvania"" because it\'s so much like Dark Souls clearly never played Super Metroid.\n\nClever level design with keyed doors and shortcuts to minimize back tracking.\n\nInteresting and memorable boss fights.\n\nHell, a 2D platforming game with a heavy parry mechanic... go play Samus Returns.\n\nYes, this game has a lot of souls-like elements, such as how you upgrade your weapons, and the general gloomy atmosphere... but those who know their game history also know that there would be no Dark Souls without Super Metroid or Castlevania.\n\nThis game has a lot of all of those things, plus a little more. If you like the sound of a metroidvania with heavy dark souls mechanics and aesthetic, then this is your game.\n\n', 'so far this game is making me feel good', 'This is a kooky game. It\'s 2D one that\'s... Metroidvaniaey so far. It\'s got boat loads (and i mean BOAT LOADS) of secret paths and hidden walls and such. It\'s got weird bosses, it\'s got some pretty solid and diverse combat (each weapon so far feels fairly distinct, my favorite is a lantern which does no damage on its own, blasting its light onto enemies, but if you hit your special attack, it does MASSIVE damage depending on the amount of stacks it has), it\'s world is absolutely weird, and a bit gross (In a good way) and it\'s challenging but not ""ohmygod i want to smash my keyboard"" challenging. And lastly, it\'s parry mechanic is fascinating (Basically, parry an enemy attack, you do good damage AND absorb part of it, and fill up a bar. If you fill up said bar fully, you can heal a bunch. BUT, only if you parry). Overall, recommended so far.\n\nTLDR: a bit 2D soulslike, a bit metroiodvania, kooky (but fun) parry mechanic, weird, gross (but good gross) world.', ""You are Mac in it's always sunny, you just want to cultivate mass."", 'very epic  game. let me tell u in chinese: 非常史詩般的遊戲', ""I'm a super big fan of Metroivanias. I've played so many I can't remember all of them. Gotta say though, this is one of the coolest and most stylized ones I've experienced in a while. The game play feels good, it's quite challenging as well. I love the anatomical horror as well, the world is so intriguing. I haven't played this much yet but I felt compelled to write a review about this. This game is a must play if you're a fan of Metroidvania's!""]"

There is a story line you go through unlocking different additions to the game like animals cooking and crafting. It is a relaxing way to spend time.', 'It\'s a nice game with potential. But, I\'d wait awhile before buying it, and then only on sale. The ""Premium Bundle"" definitely isn\'t worth the extra money (I\'d say it\'s worth more like $6).\n\nThe problem is that after a year since early access release, the game still has many problems regarding just basic balancing of things like economy, numbers of crops vs. what you need to make money, and/or progress in your game.  The most base things like showing the number of specific coins you have at the corresponding store (still shows your regular coin amounts) is really aggravating when shopping.  I\'ve seen players ask for this to be fixed time and time again, yet it still remains the same - even after last update.  In fact, updates tend to make things funkier at times. \n\nAlso, they will add more content/quests without figuring out how the new items the game adds, will be used/sold or put into inventory.  Or, a thing, like, you can now make nails at the workbench, but the inventory for nails is not enough to hold the required nails you need to make a piece of furniture.  The only place to get screws (needed to progress for so many things - argh!) is only at the market, which is so chinsy on coins and traded product, that getting screws takes many, many grinding days to get. Hence, many players stuck on no progress for too long.  It\'s just too slow to progress!\n\nOkay, sorry to go on and on (I could go on) but so many examples of those kinds of things (which have been asked to fix by several players over the last year). I don\'t know if the Developers are really listening, though they say they are and they DO respond to the discussion board comments!\n\nThe art is super cute, and story line is there, and enjoyable too. I do like the game, but it\'s just so darn frustrating to play! Keeping in mind that it is early release, hopefully they can get the game balanced and more workable soon. But for now, I can\'t recommend it.', 'fun', ""Honestly i've had loads of fun with this game. It can take a good deal of hard work to get things going but really I've just been able to blast through parts of the story and enjoy getting into the routine with my farming and enjoying the NPCs in the game. really looking forward to whats to come for this game!\n\nI do have to say I wish it wasn't so hard to get coins to a degree but I may not have found the proper method to  earn money fast yet. I'll have to keep trying!""]"
